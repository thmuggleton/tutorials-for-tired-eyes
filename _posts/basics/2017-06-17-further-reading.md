## {{ page.title }}

The preceding tutorials in this section are hopefully sufficient to get you
started with the command line on GNU/Linux and operating systems based on Unix
such as FreeBSD and Mac OS X.  This page lists some recommended reading that
will reinforce what has been covered, and also provide opportunities to
build on what you have learned.

### Alternative introductory material

These sources cover very similar ground to that discussed in the preceding
tutorials; they are included in case of omission or lack of clarity on my part:
- This command line introduction is focused specifically on GNU/Linux and is
  split into 2 parts,
  [firstly](http://www.linfo.org/command_line_lesson_1.html) providing a
  general introduction to the command line and covering the `pwd`, `ls` and
  `cd` commands, and
  [secondly](http://www.linfo.org/command_line_lesson_2.html) covering the
  `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `cp` and `mv` commands.

### More advanced material

These sources cover a wider variety of commands and more advanced usage of the
command line:
- This is a [useful reference](http://www.linfo.org/command_index.html) for
  expanding the number of commands with which you are familiar; remember that
  you can use `man` to read more about individual commands.
- This is the [best book](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) that I have read
  about using the GNU/Linux command line; it is 540-pages long, so not for the
  faint-hearted, but it is very readable and lays a great foundation on which
  to build.  There is also a [shorter
  version](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) by the same
  author.
- The Linux Documentation Project has various
  [guides](http://tldp.org/guides.html) that are related to the material
  covered on this site, including an extensive GNU/Linux [command line tools
  summary](http://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary.html).
