## {{ page.title }}

This website contains materials and references to external resources for anyone
wanting to learn about command line tools such as git and Vim.  The general
approach taken has been to try to make these as accessible as possible for a
wide audience.

The nature of the subject matter is such that this website might be of greatest
interest to software developers and system administrators.  However, the hope
is that it is also of use to anyone wanting to get more out of their computer;
specifically, I hope that this website might help a few people to make greater
use of some of the esoteric, but very useful, software that is freely
available.

### Motivations for writing this

The reasons that I decided to create this website are as follows:
- I want to learn more about various command line tools; explaining how to use
  them and/or how they work will improve my own understanding.
- Having a quick and accessible reference for obscure and/or less frequently
  used commands will be helpful to me, and also as a resource to which I can
  point others.
- As stated above, I hope that this website provides an accessible starting
  point for others to learn about the various highly useful, but at times
  intimidating, software that can assist with a variety of day-to-day tasks.
