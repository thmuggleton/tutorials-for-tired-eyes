Welcome to tutorials for tired eyes, a website for learning about git, Vim
and other command line tools.

Please note that this website has been written with GNU/Linux distributions and
operating systems based on Unix, such as FreeBSD and Mac OS X, in mind; if you
are interested in the Windows command line, you will likely be better served
elsewhere.
